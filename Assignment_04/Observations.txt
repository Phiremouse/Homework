1. The amount of the female player base is fractional compared to the male player base but their overall average purchase price and average total per person is comparable. 
2. As the 20-24 seems to be the core demo and biggest revenue generator I would be worried about the spending patterns in 15-19 and 25-29.  These are your incoming main core players and your use to be main core. I would want to study more ways to up the spending in the 15-19 group and find ways to retain player base after the core age group.
3. Most popular items show that price doesn’t really dictate how many are bought. I would wonder if some items are too high or too low. Then review the stats of these items to make sure it doesn’t throw off gameplay and the actual in-game economy.
